# Note
* ClickOnce VSTO developers need to run `enable-me-to-update-clickonce-app-i-publish.reg` after installing their ClickOnce VSTO application on their computers for the first time. Otherwise, trying to update the application, they will get the error `The customization cannot be installed because another version is currently installed and cannot be upgraded from this location.`.
