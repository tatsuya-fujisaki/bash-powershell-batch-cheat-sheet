# Note
* A ClickOnce VSTO developer needs to run `enable-me-to-update-clickonce-app-i-publish.reg` after installing his ClickOnce VSTO application on his computer for the first time. Otherwise, trying to update the application, he will get the error "The customization cannot be installed because another version is currently installed and cannot be upgraded from this location.".
